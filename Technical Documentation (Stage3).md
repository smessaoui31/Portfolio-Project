Let me explain you now what this flowchart said 
- **Front-end (React)**  
  The client web app and the admin dashboard communicate with the backend using HTTPS.  

- **Backend API (Node.js + Express)**  
  This is the core of the application. It contains three main services:  
  - **Auth Service** â†’ manages user login and authentication (JWT, passwords).  
  - **Menu Service** â†’ provides the pizza menu and manages inventory.  
  - **Order Service** â†’ handles the shopping cart, order creation, and tracking.  

- **Database (PostgreSQL via Prisma)**  
  Stores all persistent data (users, menu items, orders).  

- **Stripe (Payments)**  
  Connected to the Order Service to process payments. Stripe also sends back **webhooks** (automatic callbacks) to confirm whether a payment was successful or failed.

ðŸ‘‰ **In short:**  
The **client** makes a request â†’ the **backend** processes it â†’ data is stored in the **database** â†’ payments are handled by **Stripe**.
