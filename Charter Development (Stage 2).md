# üçï O‚ÄôFrero Pizza ‚Äì Project Documentation

---

## üéØ SMART Method

| **Criterion** | **Description** |
|---------------|-----------------|
| **Specific**  | The goal is to set up an **e-commerce website** for a pizzeria to support and expand its business. |
| **Measurable** | The website should increase the **number of customers**, the **traffic on the site**, and ultimately lead to higher **sales revenue** for the business. |
| **Achievable** | The project is feasible using the frameworks and technologies at hand. Some parts may be challenging (e.g., integrating **Stripe** for payments), but overall it is achievable within **60 days**. |
| **Relevant**   | Highly relevant for a local pizzeria. Their previous site already simplified orders, and today a modern site is essential to compete with big players like **Pizza Hut** or **Domino‚Äôs Pizza**. |
| **Time-bound** | The project must be delivered by **the end of October or early November** (see Gantt chart for planning). |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Identify Risks

### Purpose
To think ahead about possible problems during the project and how to solve them.

### Risks and Solutions

| **Risk Area**  | **What could go wrong?** | **How to reduce the risk (solution)** |
|----------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Technology** | Difficulty using some tools (e.g., Stripe for payments). | Learn early, follow tutorials, and keep extra time for payment integration. |
| **Timeline**   | Project may take longer than expected. | Follow the schedule week by week, check progress, and keep one week at the end for testing/bugs. |
| **Team**       | Only 2 main members ‚Üí delays if one is unavailable. | Share tasks clearly, use GitHub to track work, hold regular sync meetings. |
| **Testing**    | Not enough testing could leave bugs. | Test features as soon as they‚Äôre built, write small tests, reserve time for final tests. |
| **Deployment** | Problems putting the site online (DB or settings issues). | Use Vercel test environment, document all steps, and test online before the final deadline. |
| **Scope**      | Risk of adding too many features before MVP is done. | Focus only on MVP; extras added only after delivery. |
