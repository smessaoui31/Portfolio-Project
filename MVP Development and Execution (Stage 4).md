##  Project Overview

**O‚ÄôFrero Pizza** is a full-stack web application for an artisan pizza restaurant.  
The project includes:
- A **back-end API** built with **Express.js** and **Prisma ORM (PostgreSQL)**.
- A **front-end web app** built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **TailwindCSS**.
- An **admin dashboard** fully connected to the real Prisma database.
- A **client interface** featuring **JWT authentication**, **cart management**, **checkout (Stripe)**, and **order history**.

---

## MVP Goal

The goal of this MVP is to:
- Deliver a functional version of the platform allowing users to order pizzas online.
- Provide an admin interface to manage products and view orders.
- Establish a scalable architecture ready for a future SaaS evolution.

## v0. Sprint Planning

###  Objective
Divide development into short, manageable sprints with clear priorities.

###  Methodology: MoSCoW
| Priority | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Must Have** | JWT authentication, cart system, payment flow, product catalog, admin dashboard. |
| **Should Have** | Address management, client order history, admin statistics. |
| **Could Have** | Dark mode, UI animations, product images. |
| **Won‚Äôt Have** | Multi-restaurant or geolocation delivery (beyond MVP scope). |

###  Sprint Structure
- **Duration:** 2 weeks per sprint.  
- **Tools:** Trello (or Notion) for planning, GitHub for version control.  
- **Roles:**
  - **Backend Dev:** Express.js, Prisma ORM.
  - **Frontend Dev:** Next.js, API integration.
  - **QA:** Manual and automated testing.
  - **SCM:** Branching, code reviews, and merges.

##  1. Execute Development Tasks

###  Backend
- Built with **Express.js + Prisma ORM** connected to **PostgreSQL**.
- REST API Endpoints:
  - `/auth` ‚Äî Authentication & JWT.
  - `/products` ‚Äî Product listing.
  - `/categories` ‚Äî Category management.
  - `/cart` ‚Äî User cart.
  - `/orders` ‚Äî User orders.
  - `/admin/products` ‚Äî Product CRUD for admins.
  - `/admin/orders` ‚Äî Global order list for admins.
- Input validation handled with **Zod**.
- Secure role-based access control (`requireAuth`, `requireAdmin`).

### Frontend
- Developed using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **TailwindCSS**.
- Pages:
  - `/` ‚Äî Home
  - `/menu` ‚Äî Product list
  - `/cart` ‚Äî User cart
  - `/checkout` ‚Äî Stripe payment
  - `/login` ‚Äî User authentication
  - `/admin` ‚Äî Admin dashboard
- Features:
  - JWT-based authentication with persisted session.
  - Global state via React **Context API**.
  - Dynamic data fetching via `apiAuthed()`.
  - Admin dashboard with CRUD and statistics.

###  SCM & QA
- **Branch strategy:** `main`, `dev`, `feature/*`
- **Testing:**
  - Postman for API testing.
  - Front-end logs and console validation.
- **Reviews:** Pull request approval required before merging.

---

##  2. Monitor Progress and Adjust

### Daily Stand-ups
Each day:
- Review completed tasks.
- Identify blockers.
- Plan the next steps.

###  Tools
- **GitHub Projects** ‚Äî issue management.
- **MY FAMOUS YELLOW NOTEBOOK**
- **Metrics:**
  - Sprint velocity.
  - % of completed vs planned tasks.
  - Bug count and resolution rate.

## üîç 3. Conduct Sprint Reviews & Retrospectives

###  End of Sprint
- MVP demo:
  - Full JWT-based authentication.
  - User checkout process and DB persistence.
  - Admin dashboard: products and orders view.
- Collect feedback and verify user acceptance.

###  Retrospective
| Topic | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| ‚úÖ What went well | Clear architecture (front/back separation), stable Prisma DB, smooth dashboard. |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è What didn‚Äôt | CORS issues, JWT persistence, dark mode integration. |
|  What to improve | Automated testing, image uploads, refined UI/UX design. |

---

##  4. Final Integration & QA Testing

###  Full Integration
- Verified complete communication between front-end and back-end:
  - `/cart`, `/checkout/start`, `/admin/products`, `/admin/orders`, etc.
- **Stripe Sandbox**:
  - Order creation, `clientSecret` retrieval, payment confirmation.
- **Admin Dashboard**:
  - Live product list fetched from Prisma DB.
  - Detailed order view (user + items).
  - Product CRUD fully operational.

### üß© Fixes Implemented
- Fixed `/admin/products` and `/admin/orders` endpoints.
- Unified front-end requests through `apiAuthed()`.
- Removed local mock data to connect to the live DB.
